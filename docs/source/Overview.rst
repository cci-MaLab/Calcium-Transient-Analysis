Installation
------------

To install, clone the repository and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f environment.yml

For machine learning purposes we use pytorch. We are aware of the relatively large install requirement for this package and that not all users require the machine learning parts of the GUI, hence we've also
included a basic yml file that omits ml. 

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f environment_basic.yml

We also provide an equivalent pip requirements file for those who prefer to use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements_basic.txt
